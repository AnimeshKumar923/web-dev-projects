    <h2>Steps to cook poha</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Add poha to a strainer, and rinse under running water until the water
        runs clear. Make sure all the poha is wet. Let it rest while you sauté
        the other ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a heavy bottom pan on medium-high heat. Add oil to the pan and let
        it heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        (optional )Add the peanuts and saute for 1-2 minutes while stirring
        continuously. When they are roasted, take out in a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds to the oil, and let them sizzle.</li>
      <li>
        Add the curry leaves and green chili pepper. Then add the diced onions
        and stir well. Saute for a minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced potatoes. Mix well with the onions. Now cover the pan with
        a lid and cook on medium-low heat until the potatoes are cooked
        completely. Open lid and stir. Break a potato piece with the spatula to
        make sure it is cooked well. (It is important to cut the potatoes to
        small pieces so they cook quickly in 3-4 minutes)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add turmeric, salt, sugar and poha to the pan. Mix gently, until all the
        poha gets the yellow turmeric color. Change to low heat and cover the
        pan for 2 minutes. This helps to heat the poha.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat and open the lid. Sprinkle lime juice, add back the
        roasted peanuts (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        You can taste test, and adjust salt as needed. Garnish with cilantro
        leaves and any optional garnishes.
      </li>
