    <h2>What is this 'Idli'?</h2>
    <p>
      Idli is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular
      as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made
      by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and
      rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are
      more readily metabolised by the body.

      Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from
      semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
