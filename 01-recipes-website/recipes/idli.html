    <h2>What is this 'Idli'?</h2>
    <p>
      Idli is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular
      as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made
      by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and
      rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are
      more readily metabolised by the body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Idli has several variations, including rava idli, which is made from
      semolina. Regional variants include sanna of Konkan.
